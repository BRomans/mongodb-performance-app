A Java Spring application to perform stress tests on MongoDb. 
The software is actually in alpha version and it is not entirely configurable for easy use.
Results of the tests and description of the experiment can be found in my dissertation repository, here on Github.
I'm planning to finish this software someday adding the support for other NoSql databases, more statistically meaningful values to reports and some other cool functions.
Any contribute is well accepted.
